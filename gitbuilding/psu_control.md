# Power Suply Unit and control box
You will fin here how to make the box for PSU and control.

## Cut the PMMA sheets {pagestep}
Cut the [5 mm PMMA sheets](Parts.yaml#PMMAsheet){qty:2} (2 sheets should be enough). Files are available for laser cutter with [DXF format by clicking here](files/dxf/psu_control_box.dxf), and the FreeCAD files are availables by clicking here if you want to make any change or export the files in another format.  

These pieces were cut on a [60W CO2 laser cutter](Parts.yaml#LaserCutter){qty:1, Cat: tool}, with the following parameters (*note that the parameters depend on the machine and its laser power*):  
* Speed : 5 mm/s;  
* Power : 100%.

## Glue the PMMA sheets
For this step, we recommend to assemble the box in a first place to make sure the cut work properly, and to avoid gluing parts the wrong way. On the followinf image, the pieces to glue are shown with red edges where glue should be added.

Glue the PMMA sheets you just cut with [glue for acrylic sheets](Parts.yaml#AcrylicGlue){qty:1, Cat:part}. For clean gluing, use [masking tape](Parts.yaml#MaskingTape){qty:1} on borders near the parts were the glue is applied.
